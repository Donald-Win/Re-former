// ── Changelog ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Each entry in CHANGELOGS is a batch with a unique version key.
// Users see ALL batches they haven't dismissed yet — so if you push two
// updates before a user opens the app, they'll see both in sequence.
//
// To announce an update:
//   1. Add a NEW object to the TOP of the CHANGELOGS array
//   2. Give it a unique `version` string
//   3. Fill in the `changes` array
//   4. Deploy — users see it once, then never again
//
// To deploy silently: don't touch this file.
